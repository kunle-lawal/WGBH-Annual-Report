                            that guide WGBH’s work are rooted in the principles
                            that also guide our democracy.

                            <br>

                            At a time in our nation when we are struggling to hear
                            one another, community­based public media is a
                            steadying force, holding true to our founding
                            principles by sharing content that educates, fosters
                            citizen participation and builds understanding and
                            trust.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            WGBH makes an impact because we create
                            programs of enduring social value that share
                            knowledge freely, making it accessible to all. WGBH’s
                            broadcasts have enormous local and national reach,
                            but with ever­expanding digital opportunities, we now
                            consider broadcast just the beginning. Our production
                            teams are re­imagining our content for audiences
                            using tablets and apps, streaming online, on phones
                            or on­demand or listening on smart speakers. With
                            our Emerging Platforms Initiative, WGBH is tapping
                            the promise of social media to build our storytelling
                            and engagement with the next generation of citizens,
                            creating community in new ways.

                            Amidst this changing and fragmented media
                            landscape, our public media mission matters more
                            than ever. We are committed to remaining a forum for
                            stories that may not find their way into the
                            mainstream, being a voice for those who otherwise

                            governed media in the country, public media is everyone’s resource,
                            accountable to the public. And through our forums, WGBH creates
                            an environment in which our leaders and the public can directly
                            engage to better understand one another. We provide this
                            connection every month in our studio at the Boston Public Library, a
                            collaboration aligned in common purpose and mission of making
                            knowledge free to all.

                            Thomas Jefferson considered the enlightenment of citizens to be
                            indispensable to the success of our republic. In following that
                            framework, public media strengthens our society and deepens our
                            democracy.
