                            Knowledge. Community. Accountability. The principles that guide WGBH’s work are rooted in
                            the principles that also guide our democracy.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            At a time in our nation when we are struggling to hear one another, community-based public media is a steadying force,
                            holding true to our founding principles by sharing content that educates, fosters citizen participation and builds
                            understanding and trust.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            WGBH makes an impact because we create programs of enduring social value that share knowledge freely, making it
                            accessible to all. WGBH’s TV and radio broadcasts have enormous local and national reach, but with ever-expanding
                            digital opportunities, we now consider broadcast just the beginning. Our production teams are reimagining our content
                            for audiences using tablets, apps, online streams, smart phones and smart speakers. With our Emerging Platforms
                            Initiative, WGBH is tapping the promise of social media to build our storytelling and engagement with the next
                            generation of citizens, creating community in new ways.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Amid this changing and fragmented media landscape, our public media mission matters more than ever. We are committed to
                            remaining a forum for stories that may not find their way into the mainstream, being a voice for those who otherwise

                        <p>
                            would not be heard. As the last locally owned, operated and governed media in the country, public media is everyone’s
                            resource, accountable to the public, and we make sure it’s available wherever and whenever audiences seek it. And
                            through our forums, WGBH creates an environment in which our leaders and the public can directly engage to better
                            understand one another. We provide this crucial connection every month in our studio at the Boston Public Library, a
                            collaboration aligned in common purpose and mission of making knowledge free to all.

                            Thomas Jefferson considered the enlightenment of citizens to be indispensable to the success of our nation. In
                            following that framework, public media strengthens our society and deepens our democracy

                                Some of the most pressing issues facing our democracy came to the fore through the in-depth work of our investigative
                                documentary series FRONTLINE. The two-part series Documenting Hate, in partnership with ProPublica, revealed the
                                resurgence of violent white supremacy in our country, and ultimately led to arrests and indictments of participants in
                                the fatal Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. Another threat to democracy was exposed in FRONTLINE’s powerful
                                documentary The Facebook Dilemma, which delved into the social media giant, exposing its vast surveillance
                                capabilities. As Facebook was under scrutiny by the US Congress, this two-part film was television’s most in-depth
                                investigation of the social media platform’s impact on privacy and democracy in the US and around the world and was
                                viewed by over 4 million people.

                                families and practitioners, including those here at Massachusetts General Hospital, to learn what the science of
                                addiction can tell us about how we might resolve this dire social issue.
                                
                                These issues and more at the crossroads of science, technology, education and business are explored each week with some
                                of today’s most creative thinkers on Innovation Hub, our national radio series.

                                <p>Eleanor Roosevelt said that the true purpose of education in a democracy is to produce citizens. Because education is
                                at the very heart of public media, we consider that part of our purpose as well. Many children do not have access to a
                                good education, but everyone has access to public media, and we embrace the opportunity to support learners of every
                                age.</p>

                                launched an original new animated series Pinkalicious & Peterrific, a comprehensive pre-school program designed to
                                encourage young children to explore the arts. We’re transforming WGBH’s original TV production PEEP and the Big Wide

                                combine animated stories with hands-on science activities that encourage parents to engage with their children through
                                simple science exploration. WGBH is working with partners in low-income areas throughout the country to support parents
                                by pairing them with educators so that together they foster healthy learning and development.</p>
